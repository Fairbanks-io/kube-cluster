# Intro

<img src="/img/main.svg">

With the introduction of the public cloud, the way software is developed has been undergoing significant change. Whereas in the past it was common to install services directly on bare-metal boxes in an on-prem data center, Docker and Kubernetes have transformed software deployment strategies.

Within this documentation you will find a collection of learnings gathered across a few years of trying to understand how can software be written, deployed and upgraded using these new strategies all while ensuring maximum availability for end-users.

## Code Best Practices

It all starts with quality code. From language best practices to unit testing, all of these best practices help ensure whatever you deploy is built with quality in mind.
