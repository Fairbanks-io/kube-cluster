# Testing Code

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) can be utilized to help analyze and automatically fix problems in Javascript code. ESLint also supports many [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) to help detect optimized ways of doing things, enforce best-practices and assist with formatting.

AirBnB engineering has shared a sensible set of ESLint rules via their [eslint-config-airbnb-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base) npm package which follows many industry best practices for Javascript code in production. See the [Node.js section](./node-js.md) for more information on this setup.
